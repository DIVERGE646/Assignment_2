        "1. Simplicity in reading f\n",
        "Clear syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and simple. Use space indents instead of curly\n",
        "braces. Makes it easier to read and write code. Especially for beginners\n",
        "Minimum configuration: Python avoids complex constructs common to other languages. Makes it easy to learn\n",
        "and use\n",
        "2. Versatility\n",
        "Python is a multi-purpose language. This means they can be used in a wide variety of applications.\n",
